		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I used blender and just played around with adding edges and extruding them. The entire model was created from a single cube.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>It took around 3 hours to model and another 2 hours to debug problems with the .dae file</p>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>
					I used blender to add a cube, then used extrude, scale, move, rotate and subdivide to extend and edit parts of the block. I made the two arms as separate cubes initially and union-ed them with the body afterwards. Then I ran our loop subdivison algorithm on the .dae file to generate the final result.

				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
				<p>The useful steps together probably took 3 hours but it took a long time (~8 hours total) to debug unexpected blender errors</p>
