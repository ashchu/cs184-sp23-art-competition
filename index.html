					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>We created our work by drawing images of Pokemon faces in Procreate, then uploading these images as PNG files into our Cloth Simulator as a texture. Then, we viewed our custom textures within the GUI, and made necessary changes to our images to make our Pokemon's faces not look cursed/too stretched. After we got a screenshot of all 4 textures applied on the sphere, we collaged the 4 screenshots into one PNG.</p> <hr>
					<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
					<p>3 hours</p>

					<h3>Caption</h3>
					<p>And in the half light, they're both free</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I create the model by importing an existing model and cleaning up the meshes as well as sculpting it. Then I customized pose of the character using rigging in blender. Finally, I merged a cage model with the character model, then i manually added microfacet metal effect for the character in .dae file, and diffuse shading for the bird. This collada file was intended to be rendered in project3 renderer with the environment map in the background, but the model I created has still too many non-manifold after cleaning, i ended up rendering in blender. </p> <hr>
					<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
					<p>6 hours, 4 hours cleaning the mesh and modifying .dae file so that it could be fed into project3 renderer :')</p>

					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>learnt how to use text function in blender to create a mesh from youtube video and set lighting/material, then used visual debugger on pathtracer to re-position all the lights and change light strength because it initially wasn't rendering as anything at all LOL</p> <hr>
					<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
