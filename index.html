					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I created my work using Blender sculpting. First, I created a cube. Then, I smoothed the cube and indented some areas to give an asymmetric look. Finally, I applied texture and lights at three different positions to achieve a more realistic image. 
						This was my first time using Blender and I followed three youtube tutorials to achieve my final work. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwG8P9Acno&ab_channel=WintergreenArts, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL3sPsugZt4&ab_channel=WenboZhao, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTKvOVswqpA&ab_channel=artistB.)</p> <hr>
					<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
					<p>It took about 6 hours from choosing what I wanted to create until I was done. Since it was the first time I used blender and I still had to install it and learn basic commands.

					<p>Ice cube to represent how cold this spring season is</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>We created the ice cube mesh in Blender then exported it as a .dae file. We then imported this file into our Project 3-2 code and modified the code in the .dae file to resemble glass or "ice"</p> <hr>

					<h3>Caption</h3>
					<p>Inspired by the "Jewel Net of Indra", this is a grid of mirror spheres enclosed by colorful area lights from each direction. The ideas is each sphere should reflect all of the lights, creating a fractal-like effect.</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I manually edited the .dae files of a sphere, using a python script to generate a bunch of spheres in a grid. Then I added area lights on all sides of the scene.</p> <hr>
					<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
					<p>On and off work for about 10 hours. </p>
