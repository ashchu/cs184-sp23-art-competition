				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>
					I used blender to add a cube, then used extrude, scale, move, rotate and subdivide to extend and edit parts of the block. I made the two arms as separate cubes initially and union-ed them with the body afterwards. Then I ran our loop subdivison algorithm on the .dae file to generate the final result.

				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
				<p>The useful steps together probably took 3 hours but it took a long time (~8 hours total) to debug unexpected blender errors</p>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>
					I created my model in Autodesk Maya, starting with a cube and expanding from there. After receiving staff help to get the model working in my project, I took around 50 screenshots and stitched them together in Adobe Photoshop.
				</p> <hr>
				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
				<p>It took about two hours to make the model, and a few more to troubleshoot the file and create the .gif animation.</p>

				<h3>Caption</h3>
				<p>As a kid, I was obsessed with legos. I decided to learn fusion 360 to model a realistic lego in my favorite color (royal blue) to channel that inner nostalgia.</p> <hr>
				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>
					I used Autodesk Fusion 360 for the first time to create an up-to-scale 3d model of a standard rectangular lego piece. Using the software, I created the skeleton and hollowed out the bottom of the block to mimic a real lego, also including small cylindrical pegs that help legos snap into each other. The final model spans 15.8mm by 31.8mm by 9.6mm, which is the size of a real lego block! If I had more time, I would try creating a mesh of the lego and smoothing out the edges using my subdivision code.

				<p>potato quality meshed potato mesh</p> <hr>
				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>We used Autodesk Fusion 360 to create the wire mesh and Blender to create the potato. We then imported the potato into Fusion and extruded the wire mesh profile into the potato to form the cutout and join the two objects together. We then exported that to an stl format, imported it into Blender, then exported that to dae and loaded it in meshedit.</p> <hr>

				<p>Mathematician / Subdividing - subdivide / O, chocolate wolf!</p> <hr>
				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>I created this wolf mesh in Blender, and then rendered it using Project 2's meshedit. The main base I used as a building block for the mesh was the icosphere. I built up the mesh by first crafting an icosphere for the head, the torso, the tail, and a single leg. Then, via merging vertices, edges, and faces, along with "symmetrize", I combined these meshes together to form the overall wolf-looking mesh. I also referred to some references of wolves standing to figure out how to best present the wolf's legs in a natural-looking fashion - hopefully I got close to the mark! I thought about creating a mesh of a wolf after deciding that I should leave the possibility of a dragon mesh for another day... So this wolf is inspired by the wolves in the movie: Princess Mononoke!</p> <hr>
				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>

				<p>Zuuuubaatt!!</p> <hr>
				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>For our art submission, we created a 3D model of Zubat (a Pokemon) using Blender. We mostly traced reference images from Google by aligning vertices to the shapes in the pictures. We also used several subdivision schemes within Blender across the regular polygons to make the mesh more fine-grained. The most important tool, however, was the proportional editing tool. This allowed us to mold any extrusions easily and more smoothly, giving the object a cleaner look. Finally, we upsampled some more using our meshedit program and added a shader to get the complete model.</p> <hr>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>We used Blender to morph multiple shapes into a Totoro. Most of the shapes were originally spheres that were squashed and stretched using Blender's Modeling and Sculpting modules.  Totoro's ears and whiskers are made from cones. Design credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTynALO0iE0">Youtube</a></p> <hr>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>I created my work by creating a torus, and extruding it out in ways similar to the tutorial. I made sure that the matching torus was collinear so that the concentric circles have a mesmerizing effect, with the connections between the torus and extrusions being cubes with sharp creases to accentuate features during subdivision!</p> <hr>
				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>

				<h3>Caption</h3>
				<p>This is a gif of a coral-like mesh going through loop subdivision.</p> <hr>
				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>As we experimented with Blender and its controls, we found a way to make tree-like or coral-like structures by extruding faces from the base cube to create branches and then modifying the edges to make “curves.” Putting the model into the project and running subdivision smoothed out the branches and turned them into actual curves. We then took the idea and created this model that has a lot of branches and resembles a starfish or a nerve cell (depending how you look at it).</p> <hr>
				<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
				<p>5+ hours (3+ for experimentation, 2 for creating final mesh)</p>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>At first, I tried creating each body element with separate cubes, but the project code didn't like that and put all the boxes at 0, 0. So I then used one box and created protrusions to build the body elements. I also tried creating a cape, but that made the mesh not manifold any longer and the half edge mesh didn't like that either.</p> <hr>

				<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
				<p>I used blender to create the model. In particular, I deleted some of the faces in the mesh to create the eyes and mouths. Then I used loop division to create the spooky effects. </p> <hr>
